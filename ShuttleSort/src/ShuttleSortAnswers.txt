The shuttle sort is O(n^2), but less comparisons than bubble sort.

The average performance of this sort is hard to discern because of its dependence
	on how out of order each element is.
	
This has less comparisons than bubble sort, about the same as an insertion sort, and
	somewhat slower than a selection sort.
